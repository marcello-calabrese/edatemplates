# Project Title

This is a template for exploratory data analysis. It is meant to be used as a guide for the analysis of a dataset. It is not meant to be a rigid template.
Feel free to add or remove sections as you see fit.
The goal is to provide a structure for the analysis and to make it easy to share the results with others.
